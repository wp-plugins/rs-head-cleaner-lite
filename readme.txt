== Description == 

This plugin cleans up a number of issues, doing the work of multiple plugins, improving efficiency, security, SEO, and user experience. It removes junk code from the HEAD & HTTP headers, hides the Generator/WordPress Version number, removes version numbers from CSS and JS links, and fixes the "Read more" link so it displays the entire post.

= Features =

* **Removes the Generator/WordPress Version number** from the HEAD section for security reasons. You don't want your WordPress version being visible because hackers can use it to attack your site. Even if you keep your site up to date, it still could be vulnerable to zero-day exploits.
* **Removes Version numbers from CSS and JS** in the HEAD for the same security reasons you hide WordPress version. Will also improve site loading speed because removing version numbers from the CSS & JS links will allow browsers to properly cache these files, as well as helping your site code to validate.
* **Removes junk WordPress code** from the HEAD of your site: **RSD link**, **Windows Live Writer Manifest link**, **WordPress Shortlinks** (also removed from HTTP Headers), **Adjacent Posts links (REL = PREV/NEXT)** as all are unnecessary, hurt your SEO and clutter your site code.
* **Fixes the "Read more"** link so it displays the entire post when you click, not just the part after the "#more".

Use this plugin instead of [RS Head Cleaner Plus](http://wordpress.org/plugins/rs-head-cleaner/ "RS Head Cleaner Plus") if you don't want to move JavaScript from the HEAD to your page footer. (Some themes, especially responsive themes that use JS libraries, need the JS to stay in the HEAD.)
